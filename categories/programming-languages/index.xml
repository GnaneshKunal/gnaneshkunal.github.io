      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a huge debate on Scala Implicits since they&amp;rsquo;ve introduced it to the language. Some people love it while some people comment it on making the code unpredictable. So should we use it?
Before I tell you what implicits actually are, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you what they solve.
If you have to store the details of a Person&amp;rsquo;s name and age, there are two ways to do it.
class Person(name: String, Age: Int) While this does the work we need, it&amp;rsquo;s not the right way to do it.</description>

      <description>I write JavaScript, your write JavaScript, everyone writes JavaScript. I write TypeScript, but you may not write TypeScript.
&amp;ldquo;Oh!! Who cares?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;We do.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;If that&amp;rsquo;s the case, use an alternate library, you know, each second, a shit JS library is born OUTTA NOWHERE.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;But I need your types.&amp;rdquo;
JavaScript has too many packages that it even has two Google Maps Library(React). But only one of the library has Type Definitions. It&amp;rsquo;s a pain to write your own definition file.</description>
