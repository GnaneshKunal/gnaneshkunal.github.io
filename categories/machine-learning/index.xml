      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve written a Classifier that is able to distinguish dogs from cats.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: 0. How to use a Pretrained Model 1. Apply Transfer Learning
DATASET I&amp;rsquo;ve trained the model using Kaggle&amp;rsquo;s classic dogs vs. cats dataset. The dataset can be found here
Well, I have to say it&amp;rsquo;s not plug and play. At least not for the torchvision APIs. torchvision has an ImageFolder that&amp;rsquo;s (right now) the standard to load images as well as it&amp;rsquo;s labels automatically.</description>

      <description>While I was learning Machine Learning, I made my mind not to use any of the third-party-libraries (including numpy and Pandas) until I got to know what happened in the background and feel okay to use libraries.  It was a bit harder to write everything from scratch. Even the dot product must be written, cause python doesn&amp;rsquo;t have that inbuilt.
Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ve felt comfortable and could clearly understand what is happening in the background (cause, Machine Learning is all about Math).</description>
