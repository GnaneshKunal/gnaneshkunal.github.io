      <description>Fedora is my favorite Linux distribution which is sponsored by Red Hat. Fedora 28 is out with a lot of features. Instead of upgrading my fedora using dnf-plugin-system-upgrade or the GNOME Software way, I&amp;rsquo;d always like to download the ISO and install it from a USB Flash Drive (cause that returns a pointer to the ISO and I could use it anywhere (ಠ⌣ಠ)). I have a love/hate relationship is with the Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s Automatic Partition which usually leaves with just 50GB for the Computer (/) and the rest for your $HOME.</description>
