      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using gatsbyjs and faced a lot of issues on user defined components. Adding asciinema never worked. It took me days to cleanly render my Terminal component. Most of the pluggins were still under development. Rendering a pdf was really a nightmare which at last was successful but not in a clear way. The gatsby pdf has never been started. The themes were lacking. The RSS plugin didn&amp;rsquo;t work at all.</description>
